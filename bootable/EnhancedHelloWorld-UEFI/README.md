This project contains a slowly improving "fancy" Hello-World program that runs with UEFI.
This program will be updated as the UEFI library improves, PE32+ Sections are better understood, multi-computer x64 UEFI compatibility is understood, general program logic can be sped up or program size reduced by making more calls...
Future running program GIF and details may be added here in future...
