This project is a UEFI x86-64 Hello World project taken mostly from https://wiki.osdev.org/Uefi.inc with an additional basic infinite loop added after the string is printed in order to see the string up on the display before the program exits.

This might get improved upon more later and/or a rewritten Hello World project may get added to the repository.
